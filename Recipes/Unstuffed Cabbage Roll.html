    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An unstuffed cabbage roll is basically a deconstructed version of a regular casserole. All 
        the traditional cabbage roll ingredients (cabbage, ground beef, tomatoes, other veggies, 
        and spices and seasonings) are cooked together — so you don't have to worry about 
        pre-cooking and rolling the cabbage</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Beef: This unstuffed cabbage roll recipe calls for two pounds of ground beef, but you could use ground turkey or chicken 
                if you're so inclined.</li>
            <li>Onion: A diced white or yellow onion is cooked with the beef, adding bold flavor.</li>
            <li>Cabbage: You'll need one head of cabbage, cleaned and roughly chopped.</li>
            <li>Canned Tomatoes: Traditional cabbage rolls are topped with a savory tomato-based sauce. To replicate this, use two cans 
                of diced tomatoes and one can of tomato sauce.</li>
            <li>Water: A half cup of water is enough extra liquid for this recipe. For more flavor, substitute beef broth.</li>
            <li>Seasonings: This unstuffed cabbage roll recipe is simply seasoned with garlic, salt, and ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>Rice(Optional): Though this unstuffed cabbage roll is delicious on its own, you can serve it over white or brown rice to bulk it up a bit.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How To Prepare</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Heat a Dutch oven or large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and onion in the hot Dutch oven until 
                browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.</li>
            <li>Add cabbage, tomatoes, tomato sauce, water, garlic, salt, and pepper and bring to a boil. Cover Dutch oven, reduce heat, 
                and simmer until cabbage is tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ul>
